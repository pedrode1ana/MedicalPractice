# Medical Practice Management System — .NET MAUI

## Overview
This project is a cross-platform medical practice management application built using **C# and .NET MAUI**.  
It simulates core workflows found in real clinical environments, including patient management, scheduling, and task tracking.

The goal of this project was to strengthen my understanding of:
- Cross-platform UI development
- Application architecture
- Real-world business workflows in healthcare systems

## Problem Statement
Small medical practices often rely on fragmented systems to manage patient data and daily operations.  
This project explores how a single lightweight application could streamline administrative workflows and improve organization.

##  Features
- Patient record management (create, update, delete)
- Appointment scheduling
- Task tracking for clinic staff
- Structured navigation between clinical workflows

##  Architecture & Design
- Built using .NET MAUI with C#
- Separation of concerns between:
  - UI Layer
  - Business Logic
  - Data Models
- Designed to simulate scalable enterprise-style structure

## Tech Stack
- C#
- .NET MAUI
- MVVM-style patterns (where applicable)
- Visual Studio


## 🚀 Future Improvements
- Authentication and role-based access (doctor vs admin)
- Database integration for persistent storage
- Reporting and analytics dashboard
- Secure handling of sensitive medical data

## 📚 What I Learned
- Designing multi-screen application flows
- Structuring applications for maintainability
- Translating real-world processes into software features
